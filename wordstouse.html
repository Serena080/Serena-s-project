On foods-
Since these foods make up a larger portion of a vegan diet than a typical Western diet, they can lead to a higher daily intake of certain beneficial nutrients.

Several studies have reported that vegan diets tend to provide more fiber, antioxidants, and beneficial plant compounds. They also appear to be richer in potassium, magnesium, folate, and vitamins A, C, and E.

Vegan diets even appear to be higher in iron. However, the form of iron that plants provide is not as bioavailable — meaning, your body is not as able to absorb it — as the form found in animal foods.

Yet, not all vegan diets are created equal.

For instance, poorly planned vegan diets may not provide sufficient amounts of vitamin B12, niacin, riboflavin (vitamin B2), vitamin D, calcium, iodine, selenium, or zinc.




Eating vegan can help you lose excess weight
An increasing number of people are turning to plant-based diets in hopes of shedding excess weight. While there’s no guarantee that a vegan diet will lead to weight loss, there may be some good reasons to give it a try.

Many observational studies suggest that vegans tend to be thinner and have lower body mass indexes (BMIs) than nonvegans.

In addition, several randomized controlled studies — the gold standard in scientific research — report that vegan diets are more effective for weight loss than the diets they are compared with.
Benefits of eating more plant foods
Vegans generally eat considerably more legumes, fruits, and vegetables than nonvegans. This may explain why a 2017 studyTrusted Source found that vegans may benefit from a 15% lower risk of developing cancer.

For instance, eating legumes regularly may reduce your risk of colorectal cancer by 9–18%.

And according to the National Cancer InstituteTrusted Source, eating higher amounts of plant-based foods reduces your risk of several types of cancer, including stomach, lung, mouth, and throat cancers.

It may also reduce the risk of colon, prostate, and pancreatic cancers.

What’s more, vegan diets generally contain more soy products, which may offer some protection against breast cancer.
