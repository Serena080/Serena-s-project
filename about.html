                    <p>At Palmar, we believe caring for indoor plants shouldn’t be complicated. Whether you’re just starting out or refining your plant care routine, these 10 tips cover the essentials — with everything we’ve learned from growing, shipping and living with thousands of houseplants across the UK</p>


                    <p>1. Buy from a trusted, specialist seller
Not all plants are equal. Mass-produced supermarket or DIY shop plants are often stressed before they even arrive in your home. When you buy from a trusted, specialist shop like Happy Houseplants, your plants are grown and handled with care, packed by experts, and supported by real advice.

You can learn more about avoiding common pitfalls in our How Not to Kill Your Houseplants guide.</p>
<p>2. Light first, plant second
Before falling in love with a plant, take a moment to check your space. Bright south-facing rooms suit sun-loving varieties, while north-facing corners need plants that tolerate lower light.

If you’ve got a shady space, try a Cast Iron Plant or ZZ Plant. For brighter rooms, we love Ficus elastica ‘Belize’</p>

                         <p>3. Water with care, not on a schedule
It’s better to underwater than overwater. Before you reach for the watering can, check the top few centimetres of soil — if it’s dry, go ahead. If it’s still moist, leave it a few days. Always use room-temperature water and pour directly at the base of the plant, avoiding the leaves.

You'll find more watering tips in our beginner’s care guide.</p>

                        <p>4. Use organic plant food during the growing season
From spring to early autumn, most houseplants benefit from a light feed every couple of weeks. We recommend our Original Vegan Plant Food — it’s organic, cruelty-free and made with seaweed, packed with natural minerals to promote healthy growth.

If you’re caring for cacti or succulents, try our Cactus & Succulent Vegan Plant Food.</p>

                         <p>5. Boost humidity for tropical plants
Many of our favourite houseplants — calatheas, alocasias, ferns — come from humid tropical environments. To help them thrive in a UK home, try misting, grouping plants together, or placing them on trays filled with water and pebbles.

You don’t need to boost humidity for succulents or desert plants — they’re happiest with dry air and plenty of sun.</p>
<p>6. Keep temperatures consistent
Most houseplants prefer a stable environment between 18–24°C. Avoid placing them next to radiators, draughty windows or air conditioners — sudden temperature changes can lead to wilting, dropped leaves or brown tips.</p>

                         <p>7. Let new plants adjust to their surroundings
When you bring home a new plant (or it arrives in the post), give it time to settle in. A little leaf drop or yellowing is normal. Keep watering consistent, avoid moving it around too much, and resist the urge to repot straight away.</p>
<p>8. Repot to refresh the soil, not just for size
Most houseplants don’t need repotting as often as you’d think. A good rule of thumb is every 12 to 18 months — or when you see roots growing out the bottom of the pot. Choose a new pot just one size up and always use fresh, peat-free compost.

If you're not sure whether to repot or refresh the soil, check out our six-step guide to bringing a houseplant back to life.</p>

                              <p>Since these foods make up a larger portion of a vegan diet than a typical Western diet, they can lead to a higher daily intake of certain beneficial nutrients.

Several studies have reported that vegan diets tend to provide more fiber, antioxidants, and beneficial plant compounds. They also appear to be richer in potassium, magnesium, folate, and vitamins A, C, and E.

Vegan diets even appear to be higher in iron. However, the form of iron that plants provide is not as bioavailable — meaning, your body is not as able to absorb it — as the form found in animal foods.

Yet, not all vegan diets are created equal.</p>
